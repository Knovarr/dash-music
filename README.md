# dash-music-history

This is a web application that shows my whole music listening history over the last 4 years. 

The data is gathered using my Apple Music Subscription in the form of a csv file.

This web application uses Python, HTML, CSS, and then brought together using Dash.

Finally, the web application is hosted on Heroku.
